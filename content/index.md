Fernglen Gardens are located in Kauri Road, Birkenhead and owned by the Auckland Council and administered by the Auckland Council Parks Department.

Fernglen is devoted solely to the growing and preservation of New Zealand plants. The gardens consist of approximately 9 acres of Kauri Association bush with roughly half an acre under cultivation.

Well maintained walking tracks provide an excellent opportunity to observe many interesting species including two 300 year old kauri and ancient rimus clothed in epiphytes.
